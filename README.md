# Lithology-Prediction-using-ML-Models
This project focuses on lithology prediction using well log data and supervised machine learning models. Advanced preprocessing and feature extraction were applied on large datasets, achieving 91% accuracy with a Neural Network. The model supports improved reservoir characterization and drilling efficiency.
